# MQL4/5_automated_trading

EA.mq4 is the template file, not to be used in any serious trading system. Most other EAs are variations of this, using various combinations of technical indicators. 

Fibonaccis as inputs seem to show better results. 

I have more stuff in progress. 

Feel free to use but please share if you can tweak them to get better results. I'd be happy to collaborate with you if you're serious about developing a strategy. 

Use at your own risk. Most of these are templates at best, and I will be not responsible for anybody's losses from using these. 

Make sure you use Magic Numbers.
